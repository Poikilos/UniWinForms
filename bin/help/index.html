The Program will load CSharp files, and look for the other file where
partial classes are used (i.e. MainForm.cs and MainForm.Designer.cs),
so that you can edit the forms.<br><br><br>Purpose:<br><br>This
program
is intended to be a smart solution to forms design where
framework-dependent (i.e. System.Design) programs have failed. &nbsp;It
breaks the code into chunks then processes it manually, so their is no
need for&nbsp;code regeneration (one that a designer "eats code"); the
requisite absence of syntax errors; nor dependence on
special&nbsp;formatting (i.e. "#region
Windows Form Designer generated code"). &nbsp;These issues can
all be avoided by this departure from the&nbsp;Framework's
"prepackaged"&nbsp;form design methodology. &nbsp;The program uses
"fuzzy" detection if form control values, and keeps the "fuzz" when it
is finished editing the parameters, so you don't lose your code.<br><br><br>Support:<br><br>Please send bugs to <a href="mailto:uniwinforms@expertmultimedia.com">uniwinforms@expertmultimedia.com</a> or look on the <a href="http://www.expertmultimedia.com/orangejuice">website</a> under Projects in case solutions are posted.</body></html>
